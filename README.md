## Getting Started

<br/>

### Environment

To run this app will require an `.env` file with following keys:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORG_NAME= GitHub Organization login name (same as the one that you created the token with)

PRIVATE_KEY= Private key to generate authorization token to communicate with Giftless

GIFTLESS_SERVER= URL from Giftless server

APP_GITHUB_KEY= API key to access GitHub required data, follow this documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

REFRESH_DATA_IN_METASTORE= Set if the metastore data will refresh automatically (true/false)

//This env should be enabled when you want to mock the service worker to run tests
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCKING= enabled/disabled

// To get the following information, you can check this link: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= GitHub client ID from APP

GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= GitHub client secret

SIGNING_KEY= Signin key to use on APP from GitHub

NEXTAUTH_URL= GitHub login callback URL
```
<br />

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## E2E Test

To test the app end to end using Cypress:

```bash
yarn e2e
# or
npm run e2e
```

## Unit Tests

The unit tests are using `jest`. To add more tests, you should follow the structure to add new ones inside `__tests__` directory.
You can run the tests with the following commands:
<br />

> Just run the tests

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

<br />

> Run tests with hot reload

```bash
npm run test:watch
# or
yarn test:watch
```

<br />

## Integration and E2E Tests

Those tests are made using Cypress. 
To add more tests you can follow the structure on the `cypress` directory.

- If you will update any view or change the workflow, ensure that the tests will run correctly.
- If you will need to mock some Server Side request that will not working on `cy.intercept` you can add on `mocks/handlers` folder. (We use [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) )

To run Cypress, you can use following commands:

> Run cypress UI

```bash
npm run cypress:open
# or
yarn cypress:open
```

> Tests without Video Interface

```bash
npm run cypress:ci
# or
yarn cypress:ci
```

> Run All tests

```bash
npm run e2e
# or
yarn e2e
```
 
<br />  

## Updating the Publisher

- If you will update any view or change the workflow, ensure that the tests will run correctly.
- If you will need to mock some Server Side request that will not working on `cy.intercept` you can add on `mocks/handlers` folder. (We use [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) )

To run Cypress, you can use following commands:

> Run cypress UI

```bash
npm run cypress:open
# or
yarn cypress:open
```

> Tests without Video Interface

```bash
npm run cypress:ci
# or
yarn cypress:ci
```

> Run All tests

```bash
npm run e2e
# or
yarn e2e
```
 
<br />  

## Updating the Publisher

To update the Publisher app for `gift-portal`:

```bash
# clone the gift-publisher repo
$ git clone https://github.com/datopian/gift-publisher.git

# checkout to npmpackage branch
$ git checkout origin npmpackage
```

All updates which are to be reflected in `gift-portal` publisher app should be done in the branch `npmpackage` of `gift-publisher` and also make sure no `css` is included. Hence, if the new update actually needs CSS styling, work on the `master` branch to test the styling.

Once the styling is done, copy the new update to `npmpackage` branch excluding the CSS and then publish to `npm`. To infuse into `gift-portal`:

1. Update the `giftpub` version in the `package.json`
2. Run `yarn` to install the new update
3. To make sure your CSS reflect in `gift-portal` copy all styling into `styles/pub.css`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
