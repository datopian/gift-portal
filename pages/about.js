        <p>
          The GIFT Data Portal is a free, open, and comprehensive platform
          designed by the Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency (

          . Governments can standardize and publish their fiscal data on this
          platform, for users to freely access through open-source formats such
          as CSV and JSON. It is an enabling tool for the{' '}

            High-level Principles of Fiscal Transparency, Participation, and
            Accountability
          </a>
          , that highlight the importance of the right to seek and receive
          information on fiscal policies, as well as of governments publishing,
          and reporting progress against clear and measurable fiscal policy
          objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool is also useful for the analysis and better understanding of
          the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including their costing. The
          SDGs have specific targets, such as those related to poverty
          eradication, inequality reduction and environmental protection.
          Governments mobilize a significant number of public resources towards
          their attainment, however, the details of this are not always
          available and/or clear. The GIFT Data Portal provides a tool for the
          publication of this detailed tagged data, data that can be used to
          better understand how governments are practically aiming to achieve
          their SDG targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, this tool is instrumental for the implementation of SDG
          16 which focuses on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and
          building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions. This, by
          advancing access to information in open formats which promote in depth
          evidence-based analysis of budget allocations, using efficiency,
          effectiveness, equity, and integrity considerations, as well as
          multiplying the entry points for public oversight. It also fosters
          digital innovation which in turns has a great potential to improve the
          design, implementation, and evaluation of fiscal policy.
        </p>
        <h2 className='text-2xl pb-4 pt-8'>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Users can download standardized, open data that they can use to do
          their own analyses and ask further questions. This enables them to
          establish contexts and develop knowledge as a basis for evidence-based
          approaches to inform their work/activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, the tool uses{' '}

          as an engine to operate and manage the information.

          repositories. It also greatly facilitates the provision of the data
